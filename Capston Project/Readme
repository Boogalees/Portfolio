FreeRTOS with 802.15.4 which our team made.(2016.01 ~ 2016.11)

We used CC2538(TI) SoC & RF module(CC2538 kit)


Tech note.
1. Customize FreeRTOS source code to CC2538 SoC
   (FreeRTOS didn't support anymore CC2538 & CCS Tool)
2. Make 802.15.4 Non Beacon enabled mode 
   (Reference_ Freak 802.15.4)
3. Simple Task Scheduliong in Coordiator.
   (RFD doesn't need to use RTOS)
